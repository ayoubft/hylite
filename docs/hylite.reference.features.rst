hylite.reference.features package
=================================

This module contains a collection of HyFeature instances that approximate commonly
encountered absorbtion features. These are organised into two themes: *features*,
which contains generic absorbtions, and *minerals* which characterises the spectral
signature of commonly observed minerals.

These data are largely used for labelling/annotating figures and are not necessarily accurate.
